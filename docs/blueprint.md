## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light gray (#F5F7FA) to provide a clean, data-focused backdrop.
- Primary color: Solana purple (#9945FF) for key elements and branding. This vibrant color helps connect the interface to the Solana ecosystem.
- Accent color: Solana teal (#14F195) to highlight interactive elements and important information, providing a pop of contrast against the primary and background.
- Headings font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for headings, providing a clear and modern look.
- Addresses and code font: 'Fira Code' (monospace) for wallet addresses and code snippets.
- Design System: Cards with subtle shadows and rounded corners to maintain an organized information hierarchy inspired by Solscan.io.
- Subtle transitions on data updates, for example a slight 'fade' effect as numbers change. Very short in duration (0.2 seconds) so that the frequent updates don't distract.
